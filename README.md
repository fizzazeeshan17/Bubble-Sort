# Bubble-Sort

# Language: Python

# Description:

A subsystem responsible for delivering priority numbers to an automated irrigation system has stopped working and you need to deliver a quick fix that will work until the actual subsystem is fixed by senior developer.

As you are the newest addition to the development team you have not fully grasped the complete picture of how all the systems work yet but you are confident you can solve this as you got a few hints from a senior developer.

Here is what the senior developer told you as he was running out the door.

There are two files with numbers in them
Each line in the files can contain one or more numbers, if there are more than one number on a line, they are separated by spaces
Both files will contain both odd and even numbers
You need to create a filter that can pick all odd numbers from one file and all even numbers from the other file
You then need to combine all the filtered out odd and even numbers (from the two files), and sort them in a reversed order using something called Bubble Sort.
He did not say it explicitly but you also understood that when you are done with the above steps, you need to display the sorted list of numbers on the screen.

When it comes to the design of the script there are a few requirements, there needs to be a main function that parses two command line arguments to file paths. From the first file (first argument) all odd numbers are read, and from the second file (second argument) all even numbers are read. The two lists of numbers are then combined and reverse sorted. The result from the sort is displayed on screen.
